<p>This statement is incomplete.  It tells us what the VDA 6.3 customer satisfaction survey results <em>show</em>, but not what those results <em>are</em>.  To be useful, we need the actual data or a summary of the data from the survey.  For example, we could have:</p><p><em> <strong>Specific metrics:</strong>  "The VDA 6.3 customer satisfaction survey revealed an average satisfaction score of 4.2 out of 5, with particularly high satisfaction (4.8/5) regarding product quality and lower satisfaction (3.9/5) concerning delivery times."<br></em> <strong>Qualitative findings:</strong> "The VDA 6.3 customer satisfaction survey indicated strong overall satisfaction, although several respondents mentioned a need for improved communication during the order process."<br>* <strong>Trend analysis:</strong> "The VDA 6.3 customer satisfaction survey shows a 10% increase in overall satisfaction compared to the previous year's survey, driven primarily by improvements in customer service responsiveness."</p><p>Without the actual results, the statement "VDA 6.3 customer satisfaction survey results: Show customer satisfaction with products and services" is only a description of the survey's purpose, not its findings.<br></p>
