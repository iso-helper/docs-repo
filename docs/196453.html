<p>ISO 13485:2016 doesn\'t dictate the exact wording for a Quality Policy, but it requires a documented quality policy that is appropriate to the organization\'s size and type, and the complexity of its processes.  The policy must be readily accessible and understood by all employees.  Therefore, there isn\'t a single \"correct\" example.  However, a good quality policy reflecting the high-level management commitment under ISO 13485:2016 would include elements like these:</p><p><strong>Quality Policy (High-Level Management Commitment) - Example</strong></p><p>[Company Name] is committed to providing high-quality medical devices that consistently meet or exceed customer and regulatory requirements.  We achieve this through:</p><p><em> <strong>A commitment to patient safety:</strong>  This is paramount in all our operations.  We prioritize the design, development, production, and delivery of safe and effective medical devices.<br></em> <strong>Compliance with applicable regulations:</strong> We adhere to all relevant ISO 13485:2016 requirements and other applicable national and international regulations and standards.<br><em> <strong>Continuous improvement:</strong> We are dedicated to a culture of continuous improvement, employing effective processes to identify, analyze, and mitigate risks throughout the product lifecycle.  This includes regular internal audits and management reviews.<br></em> <strong>Customer focus:</strong> We are committed to understanding and meeting our customerâ€™s needs and expectations.  We strive for strong communication and responsiveness.<br><em> <strong>Employee empowerment:</strong> We empower our employees to identify and resolve quality issues, contributing to a proactive and responsible work environment.<br></em> <strong>Effective resource management:</strong> We allocate the necessary resources (human, financial, and technological) to maintain and continuously improve our quality management system.<br><em> <strong>Supplier management:</strong> We select and manage our suppliers to ensure the quality of materials and services received.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong>  This is a template. You must tailor it to your specific organization.  Consider adding:</p><p></em> <strong>Specific details relevant to your organization\'s products and services.</strong>  What are your key characteristics of quality? (e.g., reliability, safety, performance)<br><em> <strong>Measurable objectives.</strong> How will you measure success in achieving your quality policy goals? (e.g., reduction in nonconformances, customer satisfaction scores)<br></em> <strong>Signatures and date of approval.</strong>  This demonstrates high-level management commitment.</p><p>Remember that the quality policy needs to be more than just a statement; it needs to be implemented and reflected in day-to-day operations.  Regular management review of the effectiveness of the quality management system is crucial in ensuring the policy remains relevant and effective.<br></p>
