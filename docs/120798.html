Here are a few options, depending on the context:</p><p><strong>Option 1 (Concise):</strong></p><p>> VDA 6.3 customer satisfaction surveys reveal customer satisfaction levels with products and services.</p><p><strong>Option 2 (More descriptive):</strong></p><p>> The results of the VDA 6.3 customer satisfaction survey indicate the degree of customer satisfaction with both products and services.</p><p><strong>Option 3 (Adding potential action):</strong></p><p>> VDA 6.3 customer satisfaction survey results show customer satisfaction levels with products and services, providing valuable data for improvement initiatives.</p><p><strong>Option 4 (If specific results are known):</strong></p><p>>  The VDA 6.3 customer satisfaction survey revealed [Specific data, e.g., a high level of satisfaction with product X but lower satisfaction with service Y].</p><p>The best option depends on what you want to emphasize and the overall message.  Simply stating that the survey <em>shows</em> satisfaction isn't very informative without further context or data.  Adding specifics about the results would make the statement much stronger.<br></p>
